I dont want to say how much trouble this gave me. It tested on night before closing down for bed. Came back the next morning and when i opened the project, I was greeted by three errors across my screen. Upon installing updates that were "needed" my entire json-package was blank. After this it only got worse.... regardless, after building everything from scratch (five times) then asking for help from other students it is working. BTW it took me hours to figure out this line is not good anymore --> mongoose.set('useCreateIndex', true);

From what I have found useCreateIndex is depricated and no longer in use.
